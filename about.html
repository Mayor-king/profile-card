                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Mayowa Lawal, a passionate Frontend Developer and aspiring Software Engineer 
                        based in Lagos, Nigeria. My journey into tech began with a fascination for how websites 
                        work and has evolved into a deep commitment to creating beautiful, accessible, and 
                        user-friendly web experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in the power of clean code and thoughtful design to solve real-world problems. 
                        When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the basketball court, reading tech blogs, or 
                        spending quality time with friends. I'm driven by continuous learning and the excitement 
                        of building things that make a difference.

                        I'm embarking on this journey with clear objectives that will shape my growth as a developer:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Master modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries to build scalable applications</li>
                        <li>Develop a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms for technical interviews</li>
                        <li>Build a diverse portfolio of projects that demonstrate real-world problem-solving skills</li>
                        <li>Learn industry best practices for code quality, testing, and deployment</li>
                        <li>Network with fellow developers and mentors to accelerate my learning journey</li>
                        <li>Gain confidence in tackling complex technical challenges independently</li>
                        <li>Contribute to open-source projects and give back to the developer community</li>

                        Areas of Low Confidence
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Growth requires honest self-assessment. Here are areas where I'm working to build more confidence:
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Backend Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        While I'm comfortable with frontend technologies, backend development with databases, 
                        server-side logic, and APIs still feels intimidating. I'm actively working to bridge 
                        this gap through hands-on projects and structured learning.
                    </p>

                    <h3>System Design & Architecture</h3>
                    <p>
                        Understanding how to design scalable systems and make architectural decisions for large 
                        applications is an area I need to strengthen. I'm studying system design patterns and 
                        learning from experienced engineers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Technical Interviews</h3>
                    <p>
                        The pressure of live coding interviews and whiteboard sessions makes me nervous. I'm 
                        practicing algorithms daily and working on communicating my thought process more clearly.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Advanced JavaScript Concepts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Topics like closures, prototypal inheritance, and asynchronous programming patterns 
                        sometimes trip me up. I'm committed to deepening my understanding through deliberate 
                        practice and building projects that leverage these concepts.
                    </p>

                        Note to Future Self
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Dear Future Mayowa,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're reading this, you've come a long way from where you started. Remember when 
                        you felt overwhelmed by all the technologies you needed to learn? When imposter syndrome 
                        made you question if you belonged in tech? Look at how far you've come!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Never forget why you started this journeyâ€”the excitement of building something from 
                        nothing, the joy of solving problems, and the desire to create tools that help people. 
                        Stay curious, stay humble, and keep pushing your boundaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The challenges you face today are preparing you for opportunities you can't yet imagine. 
                        Trust the process, celebrate small wins, and remember that every expert was once a beginner. 
                        Keep coding, keep learning, and most importantly, enjoy the journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You've got this! ðŸš€
                    </p>

                <!-- Extra Thoughts Section -->

                    <h2 id="extra-heading">
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i>
                        Extra Thoughts
                    </h2>
                    
                    <h3>On Learning in Public</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've learned that sharing my journey, including mistakes and struggles, not only helps 
                        others but also reinforces my own learning. Documentation, blog posts, and code reviews 
                        are powerful tools for growth.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Power of Community</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tech can feel isolating, but connecting with other developersâ€”through meetups, online 
                        communities, or pair programmingâ€”has been invaluable. There's something special about 
                        collaborative problem-solving and celebrating each other's wins.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Balance and Burnout Prevention</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm learning that sustainable growth requires rest. Basketball, time with friends, and 
                        disconnecting from screens aren't distractions from productivityâ€”they're essential for 
                        maintaining long-term passion and creativity.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility Matters</h3>
                    <p>
                        Building inclusive web experiences isn't just a technical requirementâ€”it's a moral 
                        imperative. Every user deserves equal access to digital products, and I'm committed to 
                        making accessibility a core part of my development practice.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Journey Ahead</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited about what lies ahead. Whether it's mastering new frameworks, contributing 
                        to meaningful projects, or mentoring others, I know that every step forward is progress. 
                        The tech industry is vast and ever-changing, and that's exactly what makes it exciting.
                    </p>
